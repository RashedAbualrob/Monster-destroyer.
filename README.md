This is a code made for a collaborative proyect. It was made in conjunction with Melvyn Fontan (MelvynFontan) and Guillermo A Davila (Guillermo-A-Davila). It is a simple RPG game that uses arrays, loops and Variables.

The code starts with a loop that can take you to the game itself, credits, and an exit. The gameplay is very simple, once you start the game, it will ask you if you would like to fight the boss or run away. If you run away the game will end and call you a coward, if you choose to fight, you will continously attack the boss until it's vanquished.
